Thinkful Final Capstone - Cervical Cancer Screening

Cervical Cancer is easily preventable in its precancerous stages. In order to prescribe the correct treatment, health care practitioners must determine the patient's cervix type. There are three types (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3).

This final capstone uses image segmentation and convolutional neural network architectures to build a medical image classifier. The various CNN architectures include VGG-16, Alex-Net and DenseNet.

Concepts and Tools used: Convolutional Neural Networks, Oracle VM Virtual Box, Linux OS, Amazon EC2, Computer Vision
